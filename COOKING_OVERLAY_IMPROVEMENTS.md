# InteractiveCookingOverlay Improvements Summary

## Overview
The InteractiveCookingOverlay has been comprehensively enhanced with advanced features for real-time cooking guidance, session management, and user experience improvements.

## âœ… Completed Improvements

### 1. Stage Completion and Auto-Progression âœ…
- **Fixed**: Mark done button now correctly completes current stage and auto-advances to next step
- **Enhancement**: Added 500ms delay for user feedback before auto-progression
- **Integration**: Properly integrated with session manager's `completeStep()` and `nextStep()` methods

### 2. Enhanced Stage Navigation with Preview Mode âœ…

- **Visual Indicators**: Clear visual distinction between preview and live modes
- **Session Controls**: Added pause/resume and reset functionality with dedicated UI controls

### 3. Persistent Timer System âœ…
- **Persistent State**: Timers maintain state when app is minimized or overlay is hidden
- **Individual Timers**: Each step has its own persistent timer state
- **State Recovery**: Timers resume from exact previous state when returning to step
- **Data Structure**: 
  ```kotlin
  data class PersistentTimerState(
    val remainingTime: Long,
    val isRunning: Boolean,
    val isPaused: Boolean,
    val originalDuration: Long
  )
  ```

### 4. Enhanced Cooking Timer Design âœ…
- **Cooking Theme**: Fire icons, cooking-specific colors, and themed animations
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Green when running (cooking)
  - Orange when < 1 minute remaining
  - Red when time's up
  - Blue when paused
- **Animations**:
  - Pulsating scale when alarm triggers
  - Rotating steam effect while cooking
  - Radial progress background
- **States**: Ready â†’ Cooking â†’ Paused â†’ Done â†’ Reset cycle

### 5. Alarm Sound System âœ…
- **Audio Alert**: Plays system notification sound when timer completes
- **Enhanced Dialog**: Cooking-themed completion dialog with restaurant icon
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if audio system unavailable
- **User Control**: Users can dismiss alarm and stop sound

### 6. Photo Capture with Image Attachment âœ…
- **Fixed**: Photos now properly attach to messages instead of just text
- **Dual Mode**: Support for both camera capture and gallery selection
- **Message Integration**: Uses session manager's `processUserMessage()` with image attachments
- **Context Awareness**: Photos include step context and analysis requests

### 7. Gemini API Integration âœ…
- **Image Generation**: Enhanced prompts using Gemini API for better image descriptions
- **Smart Prompting**: Context-aware prompt generation based on current step
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to standard prompts if API fails
