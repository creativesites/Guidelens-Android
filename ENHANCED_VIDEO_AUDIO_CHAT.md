### Smart Features Implemented

#### 1. Automatic Turn Management
```kotlin
LaunchedEffect(isUserSpeaking, isPlayingAudio, isLiveSessionActive) {
    if (isLiveSessionActive && isMicEnabled) {
        if (!isPlayingAudio && !isUserSpeaking && !isRecording) {
            liveSessionManager.startAudioInput()  // Auto-start listening
        } else if (isPlayingAudio && isRecording) {
            liveSessionManager.stopAudioInput()   // Stop when AI speaks
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. Visual Audio Feedback
```kotlin
// Dynamic microphone state visualization
icon = when {
    !isMicEnabled -> Icons.Rounded.MicOff
    isListening && audioLevel > 0.1f -> Icons.Rounded.MicNone  // User speaking
    isListening -> Icons.Rounded.Mic                          // Listening
    else -> Icons.Rounded.MicOff
}

color = when {
    !isMicEnabled -> Color.Gray
    isListening && audioLevel > 0.3f -> Color(0xFF4CAF50)    // Green when speaking
    isListening -> selectedAgent.primaryColor                // Agent color when listening
    else -> Color.Gray
}
```

#### 3. Agent-Specific Analysis
```kotlin
private fun buildAnalysisPrompt(mode: AnalysisMode, agent: Agent): String {
    val agentContext = when (agent.id) {
        "cooking" -> "You are an expert cooking instructor analyzing a cooking video frame."
        "crafting" -> "You are a master craftsperson analyzing a craft project video frame."
        "diy" -> "You are an experienced DIY expert analyzing a home improvement/repair video frame."
        "buddy" -> "You are a friendly learning assistant analyzing an educational video frame."
        else -> "You are an AI assistant analyzing this video frame."
    }
    
    return "$agentContext $modePrompt Respond naturally and conversationally as if speaking to them in real-time."
}
```

## üîß Problem Solutions

### Issue 1: AudioTrack Crashes (SIGABRT)
**Problem**: Multiple concurrent audio playback attempts causing native crashes
**Solution**: Implemented queue-based sequential playback with Mutex synchronization

### Issue 2: Text-Only Responses
**Problem**: Video overlay only provided text responses, breaking natural conversation flow  
**Solution**: Full integration with Gemini Live API for native audio generation and playback

### Issue 3: Poor Audio Visual Feedback
**Problem**: Users couldn't tell when they were being heard or when AI was responding
**Solution**: Real-time audio level visualization with color-coded microphone states

### Issue 4: Generic Analysis
**Problem**: All agents provided similar analysis regardless of their specialization
**Solution**: Agent-specific prompting system with contextual analysis modes
